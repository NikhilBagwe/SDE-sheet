=> USE OF LL: -------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. To implement Stacks and Queues we either use Arrays or Linked lists.
2. Image gallery app - we can switch/toggle between images by swiping Left or Right. This is an example of Doubly LL.
3. Music Player - You can switch between songs similar to gallery app. This is an example of Doubly LL.
4. Web Browser - We can use the left and right arrows present at the topmost left corner of the browser to navigate between pages. This is an example of Doubly LL.
5. Hashmap and Hashsets - Whenever there is a collision, we use a technique called chaining to handle it in which we use Doubly LL.

=> MEMORY LEAKAGE PROBLEM :

- Whenever you want to delete a node form LL, after deleting it make sure you free the memory occupied by it to avoid memory leakage.
