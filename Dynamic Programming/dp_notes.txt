Dynamic Programming Notes: 

* DP is enhanced recursion.
* Recursion is parent of DP.
* Whenever a recursive function is making 2 calls i.e we have 2 choices, there is a proability that we can apply DP there. 

-> How to identify a DP problem :

1. All methods used to find a recursive problem are also applicable for DP.
2. The problem asks you to find something OPTIMAL. eg: maximum, minimum, largest, etc

-> Approach to a DP problem:

1. Write it's RECURSIVE function.
2. Use memoization.
3. And then if you want than make Tabulation DP table i.e Top-Down
