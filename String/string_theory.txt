--> string str = "Microsoft"

* Substring : Group of consecutive elements. Substring can also be a subsequence but vice versa is not possible.
  eg : Mic, Micro, ros, etc

* Subsequence : We can skip certain characters in subsequence but sequence matters for example we cannot write 'ciM' as the order is changed.
  eg: st, Miro, Mit, etc
  Formula = 2 ^ (length of string)

* Subset : Here the sequence does not matters.
  eg: ciM, cro, fos, etc.
  
We can say that ,
- Every Substring can be a subsequence and subset but vice versa is not possible.
- Every Subsequence can be a subset but vice versa is not possible.
- Subset can be anything as order does not matter.
